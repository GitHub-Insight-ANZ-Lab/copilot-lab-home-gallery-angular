## Enhance a Home Gallary app using GitHub Copilot

In this fun workshop, you will learn how to use GitHub Copilot to enhance an Angular app, with little to no Angular experience required.

The project contains a simple Angular application.

Participants will be guided to install the GitHub Copilot VS Code extension, and then use it to enhance the app. You will also use GitHub Copilot to write some missing unit tests for the app. Estimated time to complete: `10 to 60 minutes`.

## FAQ 

- **How do I get a GitHub Copilot license?**
  - You can request a trial license from your GitHub Sales representative or via Copilot for Individuals or Business licenses.
- **How do I get a GitHub Codespaces license?**
    - Codespaces is included with GitHub Enterprise Cloud, GitHub Enterprise Server, and GitHub Free. You can check under your [billing settings page](https://github.com/settings/billing).
- **I am having trouble activating GitHub Copilot after I load the plugin, what should I do?**
    - This could be because you launched your Codespace before you activated GitHub Copilot or accepted the invitation to the trial org. Please try to reload your Codespace and try again.
