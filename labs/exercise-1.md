# Exercise 1: Running Angular App

## Setup

Confirm that GitHub Copilot is configured and enabled, make you that you have logged in your GitHub account in your IDE (e.g. VS Code). Check the status bar on the bottom right corner of VS Code.

## Prepare and Run Angular app

Pretend that you are new to Angular framework and do not know how to execute Angular project.

Ask in the `Copilot Chat` : `explain the steps required to run Angular app`. Review the instruction provided by copilot and follow these steps to run the `Home Gallery` Angular app. Once the Angular project is running, you should be able to see below web page in the browser.

## Tips for the lab exercise

Explore different features of GitHub Copilot. Even if you already know how to write code using Angular, you can still ask the question and see the responses from copilot. The more you use the copilot features, the more user cases you might find to speed up development work.

For the next a couple of lab exercises, we will

- Create new features in the code
- Work with external APIs
- Create documentation
- Create tests

There are many other things that Copilot can helkp you with. Feel free to explore command in the `Copilot chat` or `Drop down menus` like:

- `/fix`: to fix the problems in your code
- `/explain`: for Copilot to explain you what the code does
