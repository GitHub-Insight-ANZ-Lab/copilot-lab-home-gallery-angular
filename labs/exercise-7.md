# Exercise 7: Building tests

It's time to create automated tests to check that the functionalities of the app are correctly implemented. You can leverage Copilot to run the tests.

## Create Test Project

Ask copilot to pick a test framework like `Karma` or `Jasmine`. The copilot should give you advice on how to setup test folder structure and install packages

## Create Unit Tests

There is a `/tests` command that you can run from Copilot Chat or by selecting the piece of code you want to create tests for. 

## Generate Test Data

Copilot is very helpful to generate test data. Try to generate mock data for your unit tests above.

## Run Tests

Ask copilot how to run the tests and make sure all tests passes.

If any of the test fails, you can also try to ask copilot to fix tests.
