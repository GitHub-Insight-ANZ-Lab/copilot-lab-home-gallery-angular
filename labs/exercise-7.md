# Exercise 7: Building tests

We will create automated tests to check that the functionality of the previous endpoints is correctly implemented. You can leverage Copilot to run the tests. 

## create a test project

Ask copilot to pick a test framework like `Karma` or `Jasmine`. The copilot should give you advice on how to setup test folder structure and install packages

## create a few tests

There is a `/tests` command that you can directly run from Copilot Chat or by selecting the piece of code you want to create tests for.

## generate test data

Copilot is very helpful to generate test data. Try to generate mock data for your tests above.

## run tests

Ask copilot how to run the tests and make sure all tests passes.
