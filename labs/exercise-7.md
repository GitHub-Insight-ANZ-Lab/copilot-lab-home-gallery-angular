# Exercise 7: Building tests

We will create automated tests to check that the functionality of the previous endpoints is correctly implemented. You can leverage Copilot to run the tests. There is a `/tests` command that you can directly run from Copilot Chat or by selecting the piece of code you want to create tests for and using the Copilot inline feature.
