# Exercise 8: Create a Dockerfile

Now that we have the new functionality added and tests covering it, lets create a Dockerfile for the Angular Application.

Use the Dockerfile provided to create a docker image of the application. There are some comments in the Dockerfile that will help you to complete the exercise.

In order to build, run and test the docker image, you can use Copilot as well to generate the commands.

For instance, create a DOCKER.md file where you can store the commands to build, run and test the docker image.

Examples of steps to document: Build the container image, Run the container, Test the container.

Build the image using Copilot and expose the port 3000.
