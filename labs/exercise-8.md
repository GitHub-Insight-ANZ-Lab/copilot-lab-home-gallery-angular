# Exercise 8: Create a Dockerfile

Now that we have the `Home Gallery` app working correctly, let's create a Dockerfile for the Angular Application.

Use the `Dockerfile` file provided to create a docker image of the application. There are some comments in the Dockerfile that will help you to complete the exercise.

In order to build, run and test the docker image, you can use Copilot to generate the commands for each step.

The prompt could be: Add steps in the Dockerfile to build an image for an Angular app, expose port 3000, and run the container.

You don't need to run it if you don't have docker installed,  the key is to understand what copilot can do for development.
